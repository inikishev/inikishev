Hi! So far I've specialized in medical segmentation and optimization algorithms, but done a lot of other stuff as well. My master's thesis was in glioblastoma segmentation on MRI images using neural nets.

If you are into optimization, you might find [pytorch image descent](https://github.com/inikishev/image-descent) useful for debugging and quickly visualizing momentum or generally how an optimizer works. I've also implemented some gradient-free PyTorch optimizers in [torchzero](https://github.com/inikishev/torchzero) (pretty sure its the first library to do so!), which is useful when you need to optimize a function or a model without having access to gradients.

My first every project was a music beat swapping and automatic mixing/remixing tool with AI-based beat detection which you can try in your browser https://huggingface.co/spaces/dpe1/beat_manipulator.
